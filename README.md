* Limit the done column to only the last 24 hours???
* check if we have a bug in the number of tasks shown
* move to new app

4) allow tasks to be re-run after they are completed. (from the task list)
 -tasks should be able to be sent directly to a specific stage in the process (and then have to go thru the rest of the steps).
this is because sometimes they spot mistakes and it's confusing when people in the earlier parts of the steps have to look at it and figure out whats wrong..

3) allow all users to access the task list, but only for their own tasks
2) include a 'done' column where items done today is in there
1) the coloured board
