\f0\fs24 \cf0 Story 13: As a buyer i should be able to register to be able to use the system\
\
\
Test scenario 1: User registers , receives login and logs in to system.\
\
	click on registration link\
	enter company name and email address\
	check that we are logged in\
	check that email address receives registration details\
	registration details include a link to a complete registration page\
	complete registration page asks for password, name, contact number, fax number\
\
(i think its a good idea we allow full login initially, anyway they can't do any damage since they can only send orders, we will respond to that account which they can only re-access after they completed registration)\
\
\
Test scenario 2: user registers with wrong email address\
\
	click on registration link\
	enter company name and wrong email address\
	check that we are logged in\
	user should be able to see that he has a wrong email address, with a link to correct it\
	correct email address, void the complete registration link sent to the wrong email address\
	continue with test scenario 1 flow\
